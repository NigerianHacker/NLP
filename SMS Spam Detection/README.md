#### 2. SMS Spam Classification
- **Technologies:** Custom TF-IDF and BoW vectorizer, Naive Bayes Classifier
- **Description:** Created an SMS spam classifier implementing various text preprocessing techniques and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Performance:** [I will include specifics of model performance and feature importance analysis]
- **Future Work:** Plans include improving model performance with LSTM and I also want to implement a custom Bayes classifier.
