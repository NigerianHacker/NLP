#### 1. Transformer Model for Machine Translation (English to German)
- **Technologies:** PyTorch, Europarl Parallel Corpus, NLTK, 
- **Description:** Engineered a transformer-based machine translation system without using pre-trained weights; managed full lifecycle from model architecture design to training and evaluation.
- **Results:** Achieved a BLEU score between 50 - 60.
- **Training Details:** [I will add details about model architecture, hyperparameters, etc.]
- **Training Loss Curve:** `![Training Loss Curve](path/to/loss_curve.png)`

#### 2. SMS Spam Classification
- **Technologies:** Custom TF-IDF and BoW vectorizer, Naive Bayes Classifier
- **Description:** Created an SMS spam classifier implementing various text preprocessing techniques and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Performance:** [I will include specifics of model performance and feature importance analysis]
- **Future Work:** Plans include improving model performance with LSTM and I also want to implement a custom Bayes classifier.
